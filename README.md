# CHOP Memory Mapping
The [CHOP Memory Mapping project](https://chopmemorymaps.tumblr.com/) is designed to capture a collective memory of the Capitol Hill Occupying Protest in Seattle. The project consists of personal maps drawn from memory to capture locations and events that stand out to people who were present during the George Floyd Protests of 2020. This repository is to document the process of data capture and host files associated with the project.

The base template is drawn from [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data, converted and processed in [Open Orienteering Mapper](https://github.com/OpenOrienteering/mapper).
