# CHOP Memory Mapping
The [CHOP Memory Mapping project](https://chopmemorymaps.tumblr.com/) is designed to capture a collective memory of the Capitol Hill Occupying Protest in Seattle. The project consists of personal maps drawn from memory to capture locations and events that stand out to people who were present during the George Floyd Protests of 2020. This repository is to document the process of data capture and host files associated with the project.

The base template is drawn from [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data, converted and processed in [Open Orienteering Mapper](https://github.com/OpenOrienteering/mapper).

## About
The practice of drawing maps from memories is not about accuracy, but about place-based emotional impact. How do you navigate and perceive a space? What stands out, a year and a half later? Seattle's CHOP was central to an important moment in Seattle's history, with ongoing impact on racial solidarity, public attitudes toward police, local and broader politics, Seattle's mutual aid scene, and much more. Events unfolded both quickly and over the course of months. Even on the ground, information about events shifted and changed within the space of a single block's retelling, and information and misinformation from Twitter shaped local actions. And to my knowledge, there was never a good map made of the place.

With this project, I hope to capture some of the details of CHOP, the place-based memories that community members who were present find to be worthy of capture. I've provided a template in case that's helpful, but pen-to-blank-page mapping or your own templates are also welcomeâ€” in fact, that's more traditional to the memory mapping process, as it allows you to zoom in on the areas where you remember the most detail.

Submit maps at https://chopmemorymaps.tumblr.com/submit. The ask is that you submit only if you were there (or meaningfully involved in the moment).
